## What I learned
### Node.js:
In Node.js, I learned to create a RESTful API, covering concepts like CRUD operations, responsibility separation, Express routing, backend development with Insomnia, HTTP methods, and CORS implementation.

### React:
In React, I gained knowledge in API consumption with Axios, creating and using custom hooks for code efficiency, managing business rules through contexts, improving User Experience with SWR, understanding optimistic UI, and exploring responsive design and CSS concepts.
